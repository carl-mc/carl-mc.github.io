HEG addresses the lack of time-varying and historical data on ethnic geography that spans across state borders. It is based on a collection of 73 digitized and standardized historical ethnic maps of Europe coupled with hand-coded data on mostly violent and at times peaceful periods of major ethno-demographic change. The data map ethnic geography in Europe – defined expansively to include the Caucasus, the Levant, and Northern Africa – from 1886 to 2020 using time-variant rasters that provide estimates of the ethnic composition of local populations. Compared to prior polygon-based data, HEG efficiently combines information across multiple maps, approximates local ethnic diversity, and avoids imposing arbitrary population thresholds beyond those affecting the original map material. The data are time-variant, based on historical information, and independent of changing state borders. Because the data is based on historical maps, it only captures spatially broad patterns of ethnic geography rather than local ethnic diversity resulting from individual-level migration.\nPlease refer to this article for all details.\nData and code We provide the data for download and as a R-package on https://github.com/carl-mc/hegdata.\nCitation When using this dataset in your research, please include the following reference:\nMüller-Crepon, Carl, Guy Schvitz, and Lars-Erik Cederman (2024). “Right-Peopling” the State: Nationalism, Historical Legacies, and Ethnic Cleansing in Europe, 1886-2020.

All data and the LEDA R-package can be found on the LEDA Github page.\nAbstract abstract: Social scientists increasingly combine multiple datasets to study ethnicity in Africa. We facilitate these efforts by systematically linking over 8\u0026rsquo;100 ethnic categories from eleven databases including surveys, geographic data, and expert-coded lists. Exploiting the linguistic tree from the Ethnologue database, we propose a systematic solution to the grouping problem of ethnicity. Novel empirical results on trust in African heads of states highlight the importance of explicitly considering sample inclusion criteria and different ways of linking ethnic categories from multiple datasets. An R-package allows researchers to link ethnic groups from any database with explicit rules and to easily add their own data on ethnic groups.\nInterlinked datasets In total, we link ethnic lists drawn from eleven data sources:\n Afrobarometer Surveys All Minorities at Risk (AMAR) Census data from IPUMS Ethnic Power Relations Dataset Ethnologue languages Political Relevant Ethnic Groups from Posner (2004) Ethnic groups in Francois, Trebbi \u0026amp; Rainer (2015) Ethnic groups from Fearon (2003) GREG Data (based on the Russian Atlas Miradova) Demographic and Health Surveys Murdock Atlas Spatially Interpolated Data on Ethnicity (SIDE)  Citation When using this dataset in your research, please include the following reference:\nMüller-Crepon, Carl, Yannick I.

These data are a generalization of ethnicity-related information in the geo-coded Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). Many DHS surveys are geo-coded, thus providing a set of spatial sampling points containing local ethnic composition estimates. We use methods from geo-statistics and machine learning to estimate the ethnic composition of areas in between these sampling points to produce a continuous map of ethnic compositions for each surveyed country.\nPlease refer to this article for all details.\nLimitations Please note the following, important limitations of the data. First, DHS sampling may be not always be representative due to social phenomena, such as political violence. Although there is no systematic evidence of this, the data might in some cases be affected by local sampling bias. Second, even though for many countries SIDE covers multiple years, we caution against relying on this temporal variation for inferential purposes. Due to variation in the sampling and coding of the DHS, a substantial share of intertemporal variance in the SIDE data is random noise. Third, although the SIDE data are provided as high-resolution rasters, very local variation in the data may not be meaningful. This depends on the imputation parameters, the local density of the DHS data, and their random displacement of up to 2km (10km) in urban (rural) areas. Given these limitations, we encourage the use of SIDE for cross-national analyses that require consistent, cross-national data on local ethnic demographies, rather than single-country studies that rely on high-precision data.\nData and code We provide the data for download at http://side.ethz.ch and as a R-package on https://github.com/carl-mc/sidedata.\nCitation When using this dataset in your research, please include the following reference:\nMüller-Crepon, Carl \u0026amp; Philipp Hunziker.

With current data on administrative units (from the GAUL and GADM databases), I can trace back all unit-splits. Where units have been merged or the administrative map of a country has been redrawn completely, I make use of more than 100 digitized maps, mostly from the CIA Base Map series as well as other GIS data. I assocaite each region-periodwith its capital, which are geocoded via the geonames.org gazetteer. Changes in the location of capitals within the same boundaries of a region naturally result in new region-periods. The final data set covers 1763 unique region-periods, covering each African country from independence to 2016.\nThe data are available on this Github page.\nCitation When using this dataset in your research, please include the following reference:\nMüller-Crepon, Carl.

Our primary source consists in the Michelin maps corpus, which is a collection of large topographical maps at a resolution of 1:4,000,000. Each map shows detailed information on road infrastructure with a consistent cartographic symbology for about a third of the continent. While coverage before the 1960s is sporadic, Michelin has covered the entire African continent at intervals of approximately 5 years beginning in the mid 1960s. This makes the Michelin corpus an unparalleled source for time-variant road-network information. In total we digitize 34 map sheets, which combine into 23 maps of the entire continent. Using a custom convolutional neural network for pixel classification, we an digitize the maps in a comparatively cheap, replicable, and scaleable manner.\n","date":1459468800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1459468800,"objectID":"f011a5ed6a37e3323161e210164d9ae0","permalink":"/project/road_data/","publishdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/road_data/","section":"project","summary":"Time-varying GIS data on road networks from the Michelin map corpus 1966-2017.","tags":["Data"],"title":"African road network data","type":"project"}]
