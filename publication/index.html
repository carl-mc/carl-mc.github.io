<div id="box-174" class="is-hidden"> How does local ethnic demography affect the conduct of majoritarian elections?  Because legislative elections in majoritarian systems are contested locally, local ethno-political polarization increases the risk of pre-election violence. In districts that are polarized between politically competing ethnic groups, violence can be targeted with comparative ease at opposing voters, and can, if perpetrated collectively, mobilize the perpetrators&#39; co-ethnics. I expect no such dynamics in PR systems where political competition plays out at higher geographical levels. To test this argument, I combine new data on the ethnic composition of local populations in 22 African countries with monthly data on riots and survey data on campaign violence. Ethno-politically polarized districts in majoritarian and mixed electoral systems see substantively larger increases in the number of riots prior to legislative elections and more fear of pre-election violence among citizens than non-polarized districts in the same country and at the same time. I do not find these patterns in PR systems. The results enhance our understanding of how electoral systems interact with local ethnic demography in shaping pre-election violence. </div>

<div id="box-141" class="is-hidden"> Weak state capacity is one of the most important explanations of civil conflict. Yet, current conceptualizations of state capacity typically focus only on the state while ignoring the relational nature of armed conflict. We argue that opportunities for conflict arise where relational state capacity is low, that is, where the state has less control over its subjects than its potential challengers. This occurs in ethnic groups that are poorly accessible from the state capital, but are internally highly interconnected. To test this argument, we digitize detailed African road maps and convert them into a road atlas akin to Google Maps. We measure the accessibility and internal connectedness of groups via travel times obtained from this atlas and simulate road networks for an instrumental variable design. Our findings suggest that low relational state capacity increases the risk of armed conflict in Africa. </div>

<div id="box-146" class="is-hidden"> Ethnic identities around the world are deeply linked to the modern territorial state, yet the extent to which states have shaped and still shape ethnic groups is empirically unclear. I argue that governments at the national and subnational level have incentives to bias governance in favor of the largest ethnic groups in their territory. The resulting disadvantages for ethnic minorities can motivate minority assimilation and emigration. Both gradually align ethnic with administrative boundaries. I examine this process at the subnational level across Sub-Saharan Africa. Exploiting credibly exogenous, straight borders allows for causal identification. I find substantive increases in local population shares of administrative units&#39; predominant ethnic groups at the border, showing that administrative geographies shaped ethnic groups. Additional analyses demonstrate that ethnic assimilation and emigration of local minorities drive the phenomenon. These results highlight important effects of the territorial organization of modern governance on ethnic groups. </div>

<div id="box-163" class="is-hidden"> Putting recent challenges to state borders into perspective, this paper analyzes how ethnic geography and nationalism have caused border formation in Europe since the 19th century. We argue that the rise of nationalism created growing pressures to redraw political borders along ethnic lines, ultimately causing states to become congruent with ethnic groups. To test this argument, we introduce a new Probabilistic Spatial Partition Model that models geographic units as partitions of a planar spatial graph. Drawing on new spatial data on Europe&#39;s ethnic geography since 1855, our findings consistently show that the presence of an ethnic boundary between two locations strongly increases the probability that they are, or will become, separated by an international border. Additional analyses show that secession is an important mechanism driving this result. Lastly, we find similar dynamics of border change in Asia since the 1960s but not in Africa and the Americas. Our results highlight the endogenous formation of nation-states in Europe and beyond. *Paper available upon request.* </div>

<div id="box-193" class="is-hidden"> A large literature argues that 19th century European state building entailed the formation of nations - societies not only held together by international borders but by a common identity and culture. We study the effects of building the German Reich through phases of territorial integration, and expansion of transport networks on change towards a overarching German identity in the 19th century. We measure individual-level identity choices by analyzing first names recorded in genealogical data covering more than 10 million individuals, along with birth dates and places. We use the choice of old German instead of religious or foreign names as a proxy for national consciousness. We also develop more neutral measures of cultural homogenization by embedding unique first names into a continuous vector space, and calculating parents&#39; cultural proximity to Prussia (or any other location in our data). To isolate the causal effects of state building and increasing mobility on these outcomes, we exploit spatio-temporal variation in the territorial expansion of Prussia and the growth of transport networks. The results will contribute to the literature on state and nation building and enhance our understanding of its interaction with cultural change and ethnic homogenization. </div>

<div id="box-189" class="is-hidden"> Low levels of development and state capacity in Africa are thought to originate in colonialism in general and indirect colonial rule in particular. But despite a century of debate about the nature, causes, and consequences of direct and indirect colonial rule on the continent, data and evidence about its application are scarce. Based on newly collected historical data, this paper provides evidence for two claims that have marked the debate since its inception. First, British administrations have ruled more indirectly than French ones. French colonization led to demise of 7 out of 10 pre-colonial polities. Under British rule, 3 out of 10 polities disappeared as measured by the continuation of their lines of succession. Second, pre-colonial centralization was a crucial prerequisite for indirect rule. Local administrative data from 8 British colonies shows that British colonizers employed less administrative effort and devolved more power to native authorities where centralized institutions existed. Such a pattern did not exist in French colonies. Together, these findings improve our understanding of the long-term effects of pre-colonial institutions, the roots of regional and ethnic inequalities, and the origins of currently observed customary institutions in Africa. </div>

<div id="box-285" class="is-hidden"> Contemporary Europe largely consists of ethnically homogenous nation-states. Though often treated as exogenous, the current ethnic map is the product of a long history of ethnic homogenization that often involved considerable violence. Despite the importance of this historical transformation, it has rarely been studied systematically. As a result, we lack a clear understanding of the conditions under which states resort to forced homogenization, and which groups are likely to become the target of such efforts. This project conducts a geospatial analysis of &#39;right-peopling&#39; that uses new data on historical ethnic geography. We argue that the rise of nationalism in the 19th century made it increasingly challenging for states to rule diverse populations, which created incentives to homogenize their people through assimilation, displacement, and genocide. However, homogenization efforts also carried the risk of violent backlash of target populations against the state and members of its dominant group. From this logic, we derive the following two expectations: First, ethnic cleansing and assimilation were more likely in states where one group was large enough to claim titular status. Second, small and geographically dispersed groups were most vulnerable to forced homogenization as they lacked the capacity to mobilize. To test these claims, we introduce a new spatial dataset of ethnic groups that covers Europe from 1850 to the present. We combined information from over 80 historical ethnic maps to reduce potential distortions due to imprecision and bias and relied on secondary sources to trace changes in ethnic geography over time. The results of our analysis will contribute to a better understanding of endogenous nation-building processes that shaped the present ethnic map and contemporary cases of ethnic cleansing, such as that of the Rohingya in Myanmar and Uyghurs in China. </div>

<div id="box-143" class="is-hidden"> Rationalist developmental theories, whether statist, liberal or Marxist, expect the scale of governance to grow steadily. Yet, after increasing well into the 19th century, territorial state sizes started declining toward the end of that century and have continued to do so until today. What explains this puzzle? We argue that ethnic nationalism is a main driver of this development. To substantiate this point, we rely on various spatial data resources on state borders and ethnic maps that trace the two past centuries of European history, and global history since 1886. Our analysis is conducted at the systemic and state levels, and exploits information at the interstate dyadic level to reconstruct trends in average state size for ethnic and non-ethnic border change. We find that while nationalism exerts both integrating and disintegrating effects on states&#39; territories, it is the latter impact that has dominated. </div>

<div id="box-143" class="is-hidden"> This article investigates how local ethnic demography affects strategies of favoritism in Africa. Recent studies of ethnic favoritism report advantages of either presidents&#39; ethnic peers or home regions. As regions in multi-ethnic states are rarely perfectly homogeneous, these studies cannot disentangle whether favoritism targets entire regions or co-ethnic individuals. We argue that governments&#39; provision of goods  depends on local ethnic demographies. Where government co-ethnics are in the majority, ethno-regional favoritism benefits all locals regardless of their ethnic identity. Outside of these strongholds, incumbents pursue discriminatory strategies and only their co-ethnics gain from favoritism. We use fine-grained geographic data on ethnic demography and infant mortality to test these hypotheses. Results from rigorous fixed effects specifications that exploit temporal changes in the ethnic composition of governments support our theoretical claims. Our findings have important implications for theories of distributional politics and conflict in multi-ethnic societies. </div>

<div id="box-194" class="is-hidden"> Colonial governance in Africa varied considerably in its extent of indirect rule through precolonial institutions. Assessing the developmental consequences of indirect rule, this paper argues that it strengthened populations&#39; bargaining power and increased public service provision in return for taxation of agricultural produce, in particular cash crops. To test this argument, I exploit variation in the indirectness of colonial rule -- whereas British indirect rule increased in the centralization of precolonial institutions, the French implemented more uniform direct rule. I furthermore measure public service provision with geo-referenced education outcomes of individuals born and raised under colonial rule and use soils&#39; suitability for cash crop production as an exogenous proxy for real production. Supporting the theoretical claim, the effect of cash crop suitability on primary education increases with precolonial centralization in former British colonies, but not in French ones. Comparisons of education rates in neighboring ethnic groups with different levels of centralization and ethnic groups cut by British-French boundaries reaffirm this result. Contemporary development outcomes show patterns consistent with persistent effects of indirect rule in cash crop producing areas. The findings underscore the joint importance of political institutions and resource endowments in determining local development. </div>

<div id="box-122" class="is-hidden"> A recent literature shows that pre-colonial political centralization fosters public goods provision in contemporary Sub-Saharan Africa. In this project, we test whether differences in public goods provision across areas with varying pre-colonial centralization results from more transfers of resources from governments, in exchange for electoral support, in areas where chiefs have a historical advantage in mobilizing their communities. We first develop a simple model where an incumbent politician garners support through targeted transfers. The electoral efficiency of these transfers depends on the ability of chiefs to mobilize voters, and increases when these are co-ethnics of the incumbent. We test the distinct predictions the model generates using a newly constructed constituency-level dataset combining electoral outcomes and satellite lights from 35 Sub-Saharan African countries. </div>

<div id="box-117" class="is-hidden"> To what degree and why are traditional institutions persistent? Following up on the literature on the long-term effects of precolonial institutions in Africa, we investigate whether today&#39;s traditional institutions mirror their precolonial predecessors. We link new data on traditional institutions of African ethnic groups with Murdock&#39;s Ethnographic Atlas. We find a robust association between past and present levels of centralization. However, this persistence originates almost exclusively from former British colonies governed with more reliance on precolonial institutions than other colonies, in particular French ones. These findings contribute to research on the development and effects of traditional institutions, highlighting the need to theoretically and empirically differentiate between what we call institutional persistence and persistent effects of past institutions. </div>

<div id="box-474" class="is-hidden"> My dissertation examines the geography of state building in 20th century Africa and assesses the effects of local state capacity on development and conflict. I argue that rulers invest in building their states to increase the revenue they extract from society. Trading taxes for public services, rulers&#39; profits are constrained by their bargaining power and transaction costs. They tilt both in their favor by investing in direct or indirect rule over internal competitors and by building transport infrastructure that connects them to their people. To maximize returns, rulers target their investments to local socio-geographic environments. The result is spatial variation in state capacity, which affects local development and conflict. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The first empirical part of the dissertation analyzes African states&#39; investments into local state capacity. To analyze where colonizers increased their bargaining power, I present new data on local direct and indirect rule in French and British colonies. These data show that British governments crushed precolonial polities half as often as their French counterparts, who commanded more administrative resources and mirrored direct governance in metropolitan France. The data also show that the British ruled indirectly over precolonial states, but directly over societies without centralized institutions to co-opt. I then examine where rulers reduced their transaction costs by investing in transport infrastructure. To this end, I gather road network data from British colonial reports (1900--1950) and use machine learning to digitize road maps of post-colonial Africa (1966--2016). Highlighting the extractive roots of local state reach, I find that resource-rich areas have featured more roads and better connections to ports and capitals throughout the century.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second empirical part examines the effects of indirect rule and local state reach on development and conflict. As indirect colonial rule increased the bargaining power of local populations, indirectly ruled citizens received more public services in return for producing resources taxed by their governments, in particular cash crops. Analyses that exploit variation in indirect rule across neighboring ethnic groups and within groups split by French-British borders bolster this result. Citizens also profit from expanding trade with the government that comes with lower transaction costs. Assessing the impact of local changes in travel times towards administrative capitals, I find generally positive effects on local education, infant mortality, and nightlight emissions. Lastly, transport infrastructure allows governments to keep the peace but can also facilitate rebel mobilization. Drawing on credibly exogenous variation in simulated road networks, I find that roads that connect ethnic groups with national capitals curb conflicts, while roads that connect groups internally increase the risk of violence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  My dissertation adds to the literature by analyzing the extractive roots of local state capacity in Africa, highlighting the interaction between colonial and precolonial institutions, and focusing on the trade between states and their citizens to explain local development and conflict. New data on local state capacity in 20th century Africa enable these contributions. </div>

<div id="box-177" class="is-hidden"> Sparse and uneven transport networks fundamentally limit states&#39; ability to project power and promote development in many African countries. However, not much is known about their historical roots. This project analyzes the colonial causes and consequences of transportation networks in colonial Africa between 1900 and 1966. I argue that colonial transport networks where mostly built to connect potential centers of production with ports rather than to facilitate exchange between colonies&#39; inhabitants or defend territory against challengers. Lowering transport costs to ports, (rail)roads unleashed local cash crop and mining revolutions, increasing exports and filling the states’ coffers with taxes on the same. Empirically, I collect data from British administrative reports to reconstruct the evolution of transportation networks in 8 colonies until 1940 and draw on a continental cross-section of roads observed in 1966. Using tools from network analysis, I assess local mineral and agricultural resources as one driver of networks’ geographical development. The results shed light on the extractive origins of colonial state building. </div>

<div id="box-119" class="is-hidden"> Prominent arguments hold that African states&#39; geography limits state capacity, impedes public service provision, and slows economic development. To test this argument, I collect comprehensive panel data on a proxy of local state capacity, travel times to national and regional capitals. These are computed on a yearly 5x5km grid using time-varying data on roads and administrative units (1966-2016). I use these data to estimate the effect of changes in travel times to capitals on local education provision, infant mortality rates, and nightlight emissions. Within the same location, development outcomes generally improve as travel times to its capitals decrease. These data and results improve the measurement of state capacity and contribute to the understanding of its effects on human welfare. </div>

<div id="box-216" class="is-hidden"> Research on ethnic politics and political violence has benefited substantially from the growing availability of cross-national, geo-coded data on ethnic settlement patterns. However, because existing datasets represent ethnic homelands using aggregate polygon features, they lack information on ethnic compositions at the local level. Addressing this gap, this article introduces the Spatially Interpolated Data on Ethnicity (SIDE) dataset, a collection of 253 near-continuous maps of local ethno-linguistic, religious, and ethno-religious settlement patterns in 47 low- and middle-income countries. We create these data using spatial interpolation and machine learning methods to generalize the ethnicity-related information in the geo-coded Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). For each DHS survey we provide the ethnic, religious, and ethno-religious compositions of cells on a raster that covers the respective countries at a resolution of 30 arc-seconds. The resulting data are optimized for use with geographic information systems (GIS) software. Comparisons of SIDE with existing categorical datasets and district-level census data from Uganda and Senegal are used to assess the data&#39;s accuracy. Finally, we use the new data to study the effects of local polarization between politically relevant ethnic groups, finding a positive effect on the risk of local violence such as riots and protests. However, local ethno-political polarization is not statistically associated with violent events pertaining to larger-scale processes such as civil wars. </div>
