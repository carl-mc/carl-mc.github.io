<div id="box-155" class="is-hidden"> Many European nation-states were historically homogenized through violent ethnic cleansing. Despite its historical importance, we lack systematic evidence of the conditions under which groups where targeted with cleansing and how it impacted states&#39; ethnic demography. Rising nationalism in the 19th century threatened  multi-ethnic states with right-sizing through secessionism and irredentism. States therefore frequently turned to brutal right-peopling, in particular where cross-border minorities and those with a history of political independence increased the risk of territorial losses. We test this argument with new spatial, time-variant data on ethnic geography and ethnic cleansing from 1886 to the present. We find that minorities that politically dominated another state and those that have lost political independence were most at risk of ethnic cleansing, especially in times of interstate war. At the macro-level, our results show that ethnic cleansing increased European states&#39; ethnic homogeneity almost as much as border change. Both produced today&#39;s nation-states by aligning states and ethnic nations. </div>

<div id="box-155" class="is-hidden"> Ethnic identities around the world are deeply intertwined with modern statehood, yet the extent to which territorial governance has shaped ethnic groups is empirically unknown. I argue that governments at the national and subnational levels have incentives to bias governance in favor of large groups. The resulting disadvantages for ethnic minorities motivate their assimilation and emigration. Both gradually align ethnic groups with administrative borders. I examine the result of this process at subnational administrative borders across Sub-Saharan Africa and use credibly exogenous, straight borders for causal identification. I find substantive increases in the local population share of administrative units&#39; predominant ethnic group at units’ borders. Powerful traditional authorities and size advantages of predominant groups increase this effect. Data on minority assimilation and migration show that both drive the shaping of ethnic groups along administrative borders. These results highlight important effects of the territorial organization of modern governance on ethnic groups. </div>

<div id="box-149" class="is-hidden"> Borders define states, yet little systematic evidence explains where they are drawn. Putting recent challenges to state borders into perspective and breaking new methodological ground, this paper analyzes how ethnic geography and nationalism have shaped European borders since the 19th century. We argue that nationalism creates pressures to redraw political borders along ethnic lines, ultimately making states more congruent with ethnic groups. We introduce a Probabilistic Spatial Partition Model to test this argument, modeling state territories as partitions of a planar spatial graph. Using new data on Europe&#39;s ethnic geography since 1855, we find that ethnic boundaries increase the conditional probability that two locations they separate are, or will become, divided by a state border. Secession is an important mechanism driving this result. Similar dynamics characterize border change in Asia but not in Africa and the Americas. Our results highlight the endogenous formation of nation-states in Europe and beyond. </div>

<div id="box-151" class="is-hidden"> How do Ukrainians view the costs and benefits of armed self-defense? We examine support for different strategies Ukraine could pursue against Russia, using a conjoint survey experiment with 1,160 Ukrainian respondents, fielded in July 2022. The strategies have projected outcomes with varying degrees of political autonomy and territorial integrity and three expected costs: civilian fatalities, deaths among Ukrainian fighters, and risk of nuclear escalation. We find that Ukrainians strongly prefer strategies that fully restore Ukraine&#39;s political autonomy and territorial integrity, even if concessions would reduce the costs of fighting Russia. The moral principle of proportionality suggests that the expected costs of self-defense should not exceed its projected benefits, corresponding to calls on Ukraine to grant concessions to end the war. Our respondents&#39; choices do not reflect this logic. Instead they evoke a categorical resistance against aggression: 79 percent of respondents oppose strategies leading to a Russian-controlled government, regardless of the costs. </div>

<div id="box-146" class="is-hidden"> Having increased for centuries, territorial state size began to decline toward the end of the nineteenth century and has continued to do so. The authors argue that processes triggered by ethnic nationalism are the main drivers of this development. Their empirical approach relies on time-varying spatial data on state borders and ethnic geography since the nineteenth century. Focusing on deviations from the nation-state ideal, the authors postulate that state internal ethnic fragmentation leads to reduction in state size and that the cross-border presence of dominant ethnic groups makes state expansion more likely. Conducted at the systemic and state levels, the analysis exploits information at the interstate dyadic level to capture specific nationalist processes of border change, such as ethnic secession, unification, and irredentism. The authors find that although nationalism exerts both integrating and disintegrating effects on states&#39; territories, it is the latter impact that has dominated. </div>

<div id="box-158" class="is-hidden"> Itinerant rule, rule exercised through traveling, was a common, yet barely studied pre-modern form of governance. Studying the determinants of ruler itineraries in the Holy Roman Empire AD 919–1519, we argue that rulers focused on monitoring ``marginal&#39;&#39; elites. Powerful rulers could count on family members and thus targeted unrelated local elites. Weak emperors had to monitor their less loyal relatives and left unrelated nobles unvisited. We reconstruct emperors&#39; itineraries from 72&#39;665 dated and geolocated documents and measure territorial control by their relatives. Exploiting the weakening of imperial power through the Great Interregnum (1250-1273), we find that strong, pre-1250 emperors frequented areas controlled by their relatives relatively less. In contrast, family control increased visits post-1273. Causal identification rests on the discontinuous reduction of emperors&#39; power through the Great Interregnum and differences in family relations between subsequent emperors. The results show strategic itinerant rule as an important yet understudied form of governance.  </div>

<div id="box-149" class="is-hidden"> This paper uses the gradual expansion of the European railway network 1816--1945 to investigate how this key technological driver of modernization affected ethnic separatism. Combining new historical data on ethnic settlement areas, conflict, and railway construction, we test how railroads affected separatist conflict and successful secession as well as independence claims among peripheral ethnic groups. Difference-in-differences, event study, and instrumental variable models show that, on average, railway-based modernization increased separatist mobilization and secession. Exploring causal mechanisms, we show how railway networks can either facilitate mobilization by increasing the internal connectivity of ethnic regions or hamper it by boosting state reach. As expected, separatist responses to railway access concentrate in countries with small core groups, weak state capacity, and low levels of economic development as well as in large ethnic minority regions. Overall, our findings call for a more nuanced understanding of the effects of European modernization on nation building. </div>

<div id="box-123" class="is-hidden"> To what degree and why are traditional institutions persistent? Following up on the literature on the long-term effects of precolonial institutions in Africa, we investigate whether and where today&#39;s traditional institutions mirror their precolonial predecessors. We do so by linking data on contemporary traditional institutions of African ethnic groups with Murdock&#39;s historical Ethnographic Atlas. We find a robust association between past and present levels of institutional complexity, differentiating between institutions&#39; political centralization and functional differentiation. However, this persistence originates almost exclusively from former British colonies governed with more reliance on precolonial institutions than other colonies, in particular French ones. These findings contribute to research on the development and effects of traditional institutions, highlighting the need to account for varying persistence of traditional institutions. </div>

<div id="box-182" class="is-hidden"> While ethnicity is recognized as an important political cleavage in Sub-Saharan Africa and beyond, the extent to which ethnicity structures electoral competition is contested. We argue that the interdependence between observed voting patterns and party existence complicate micro-level analyses of voting behavior that parties as exogenously given. In turn, macro-level approaches are prone to bias from ecological inferences where ethnic divides correlate with other cleavages. We shed new light on ethnic voting and party systems by modeling both as the partitioning of voters into parties. Our network-based approach estimates the effect of ethnic cleavages on voters&#39; partitioning while conditioning on individual and geographic confounders. Based on Afrobarometer surveys, our results show strong and robust effects of ethnic divides between voters on the probability of them choosing different parties and thus the endogenous emergence of ethnically aligned parties. We explore the mechanisms by which ethnicity increases co-ethnic vote choice and alternative, non-ethnic explanations of place, economic interests, and historical contingencies. The methods we propose have the potential to narrow the gap between micro-level studies of electoral behavior and macro-level explanations of party systems. </div>

These costs, we argue, originate from states&#39; strategic use of natural protection measures to subjugate peripheral, often ethnically distinct areas, manage their populations, and extract resources from them. We propose that ethnic groups excluded from executive power are most targeted by such measures. We test this argument using Africa-wide and global spatio-temporal data on ethnic groups&#39; executive power status and natural protected areas since countries independence. Difference-in-differences models estimate the causal effect of ethno-political exclusion on the establishment of protected areas. We then examine the effects of protected areas on state repression, spatial population distributions, and local economic development as observable corollaries of governments&#39; motivations of ethnically biased environmental policies. This project promises insights on how governments strategically (mis-) use environmental protection for ethno-political control. </div>

<div id="box-127" class="is-hidden"> Prominent arguments hold that African states&#39; geography limits state capacity, impedes public service provision, and slows economic development. To test this argument, I collect comprehensive panel data on a proxy of local state capacity, travel times to national and regional capitals. These are computed on a yearly 5x5km grid using time-varying data on roads and administrative units (1966-2016). I use these data to estimate the effect of changes in travel times to capitals on local education provision, infant mortality rates, and nightlight emissions. Within the same location, development outcomes generally improve as travel times to its capitals decrease. These data and results improve the measurement of state capacity and contribute to the understanding of its effects on human welfare. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The data are available on this [Github page](https://github.com/carl-mc/state_reach_africa). </div>

<div id="box-104" class="is-hidden"> Social scientists increasingly combine multiple datasets to study ethnicity in Africa. We facilitate these efforts by systematically linking over 8&#39;100 ethnic categories from eleven databases including surveys, geographic data, and expert-coded lists.  Exploiting the linguistic tree from the Ethnologue database, we propose a systematic solution to the *grouping problem* of ethnicity. Novel empirical results on trust in African heads of states highlight the importance of explicitly considering sample inclusion criteria and different ways of linking ethnic categories from multiple datasets. An R-package allows researchers to link ethnic groups from any database with explicit rules and to easily add their own data on ethnic groups. </div>

<div id="box-175" class="is-hidden"> The design of subnational administrative units is fundamental to the functioning of states and their political topography. Yet, we lack theoretical and empirical knowledge on the determinants of the partitioning of state territories into subnational governance units. I argue that aligning administrative borders with ethnic geography increases short term governance efficiency. Yet, because such *packing* of units stabilizes ethnic identities and institutions, some governments may instead design heterogeneous units and *crack* groups to centralize power. I analyze these arguments by studying unit-design in Sub-Sahara Africa, contrasting different forms of colonial rule with new data on administrative and precolonial ethnic geographies derived from historical maps and toponyms. Modeling administrative borders with a probabilistic spatial partition model, preliminary results show evidence of packing rather than cracking: Ethnic boundaries are strongly and positively associated with administrative borders. These effects are most pronounced under more indirect British rule. In turn, no systematic effects are observed under more centralizing French rule. With novel theory, data, and methods, this paper contributes to our understanding of the ethnic roots of administrative geographies. </div>

<div id="box-125" class="is-hidden"> The recent revival of nationalism has brought a threatening return of revisionist conflict. Yet, because of its radically modernist orientation dismissing past references as irrelevant, current scholarship on nationalism and political violence offers little guidance. Taking the nationalists seriously if not literally, we study how they use narratives harking back to past &#39;golden ages&#39; to legitimize territorial claims and mobilize resources for action in post-Napoleonic Europe. Our analysis draws on geocoded data on state borders going back to the Middle Ages, combined with new spatial data on ethnic settlement areas from the 19th century retrieved from historical atlases. Our findings indicate that restorative nationalism, conceptualized as a loss of power and/or unity relative to past reference points, increases the risk of civil and interstate conflict.  </div>

<div id="box-174" class="is-hidden"> How does local ethnic demography affect the conduct of majoritarian elections?  Because legislative elections in majoritarian systems are contested locally, local ethno-political polarization increases the risk of pre-election violence. In districts that are polarized between politically competing ethnic groups, violence can be targeted with comparative ease at opposing voters, and can, if perpetrated collectively, mobilize the perpetrators&#39; co-ethnics. I expect no such dynamics in PR systems where political competition plays out at higher geographical levels. To test this argument, I combine new data on the ethnic composition of local populations in 22 African countries with monthly data on riots and survey data on campaign violence. Ethno-politically polarized districts in majoritarian and mixed electoral systems see substantively larger increases in the number of riots prior to legislative elections and more fear of pre-election violence among citizens than non-polarized districts in the same country and at the same time. I do not find these patterns in PR systems. The results enhance our understanding of how electoral systems interact with local ethnic demography in shaping pre-election violence. </div>

<div id="box-143" class="is-hidden"> This article investigates how local ethnic demography affects strategies of favoritism in Africa. Recent studies of ethnic favoritism report advantages of either presidents&#39; ethnic peers or home regions. As regions in multi-ethnic states are rarely perfectly homogeneous, these studies cannot disentangle whether favoritism targets entire regions or co-ethnic individuals. We argue that governments&#39; provision of goods  depends on local ethnic demographies. Where government co-ethnics are in the majority, ethno-regional favoritism benefits all locals regardless of their ethnic identity. Outside of these strongholds, incumbents pursue discriminatory strategies and only their co-ethnics gain from favoritism. We use fine-grained geographic data on ethnic demography and infant mortality to test these hypotheses. Results from rigorous fixed effects specifications that exploit temporal changes in the ethnic composition of governments support our theoretical claims. Our findings have important implications for theories of distributional politics and conflict in multi-ethnic societies. </div>

<div id="box-141" class="is-hidden"> Weak state capacity is one of the most important explanations of civil conflict. Yet, current conceptualizations of state capacity typically focus only on the state while ignoring the relational nature of armed conflict. We argue that opportunities for conflict arise where relational state capacity is low, that is, where the state has less control over its subjects than its potential challengers. This occurs in ethnic groups that are poorly accessible from the state capital, but are internally highly interconnected. To test this argument, we digitize detailed African road maps and convert them into a road atlas akin to Google Maps. We measure the accessibility and internal connectedness of groups via travel times obtained from this atlas and simulate road networks for an instrumental variable design. Our findings suggest that low relational state capacity increases the risk of armed conflict in Africa. </div>

<div id="box-193" class="is-hidden"> A large literature argues that 19th century European state building entailed the formation of nations - societies not only held together by international borders but by a common identity and culture. We study the effects of building the German Reich through phases of territorial integration, and expansion of transport networks on change towards a overarching German identity in the 19th century. We measure individual-level identity choices by analyzing first names recorded in genealogical data covering more than 10 million individuals, along with birth dates and places. We use the choice of old German instead of religious or foreign names as a proxy for national consciousness. We also develop more neutral measures of cultural homogenization by embedding unique first names into a continuous vector space, and calculating parents&#39; cultural proximity to Prussia (or any other location in our data). To isolate the causal effects of state building and increasing mobility on these outcomes, we exploit spatio-temporal variation in the territorial expansion of Prussia and the growth of transport networks. The results will contribute to the literature on state and nation building and enhance our understanding of its interaction with cultural change and ethnic homogenization. </div>

<div id="box-189" class="is-hidden"> Low levels of development and state capacity in Africa are thought to originate in colonialism in general and indirect colonial rule in particular. But despite a century of debate about the nature, causes, and consequences of direct and indirect colonial rule on the continent, data and evidence about its application are scarce. Based on newly collected historical data, this paper provides evidence for two claims that have marked the debate since its inception. First, British administrations have ruled more indirectly than French ones. French colonization led to demise of 7 out of 10 pre-colonial polities. Under British rule, 3 out of 10 polities disappeared as measured by the continuation of their lines of succession. Second, pre-colonial centralization was a crucial prerequisite for indirect rule. Local administrative data from 8 British colonies shows that British colonizers employed less administrative effort and devolved more power to native authorities where centralized institutions existed. Such a pattern did not exist in French colonies. Together, these findings improve our understanding of the long-term effects of pre-colonial institutions, the roots of regional and ethnic inequalities, and the origins of currently observed customary institutions in Africa. </div>

<div id="box-194" class="is-hidden"> Colonial governance in Africa varied considerably in its extent of indirect rule through precolonial institutions. Assessing the developmental consequences of indirect rule, this paper argues that it strengthened populations&#39; bargaining power and increased public service provision in return for taxation of agricultural produce, in particular cash crops. To test this argument, I exploit variation in the indirectness of colonial rule -- whereas British indirect rule increased in the centralization of precolonial institutions, the French implemented more uniform direct rule. I furthermore measure public service provision with geo-referenced education outcomes of individuals born and raised under colonial rule and use soils&#39; suitability for cash crop production as an exogenous proxy for real production. Supporting the theoretical claim, the effect of cash crop suitability on primary education increases with precolonial centralization in former British colonies, but not in French ones. Comparisons of education rates in neighboring ethnic groups with different levels of centralization and ethnic groups cut by British-French boundaries reaffirm this result. Contemporary development outcomes show patterns consistent with persistent effects of indirect rule in cash crop producing areas. The findings underscore the joint importance of political institutions and resource endowments in determining local development. </div>

<div id="box-122" class="is-hidden"> A recent literature shows that pre-colonial political centralization fosters public goods provision in contemporary Sub-Saharan Africa. In this project, we test whether differences in public goods provision across areas with varying pre-colonial centralization results from more transfers of resources from governments, in exchange for electoral support, in areas where chiefs have a historical advantage in mobilizing their communities. We first develop a simple model where an incumbent politician garners support through targeted transfers. The electoral efficiency of these transfers depends on the ability of chiefs to mobilize voters, and increases when these are co-ethnics of the incumbent. We test the distinct predictions the model generates using a newly constructed constituency-level dataset combining electoral outcomes and satellite lights from 35 Sub-Saharan African countries. </div>

<div id="box-480" class="is-hidden"> My dissertation examines the geography of state building in 20th century Africa and assesses the effects of local state capacity on development and conflict. I argue that rulers invest in building their states to increase the revenue they extract from society. Trading taxes for public services, rulers&#39; profits are constrained by their bargaining power and transaction costs. They tilt both in their favor by investing in direct or indirect rule over internal competitors and by building transport infrastructure that connects them to their people. To maximize returns, rulers target their investments to local socio-geographic environments. The result is spatial variation in state capacity, which affects local development and conflict.  \
\
The first empirical part of the dissertation analyzes African states&#39; investments into local state capacity. To analyze where colonizers increased their bargaining power, I present new data on local direct and indirect rule in French and British colonies. These data show that British governments crushed precolonial polities half as often as their French counterparts, who commanded more administrative resources and mirrored direct governance in metropolitan France. The data also show that the British ruled indirectly over precolonial states, but directly over societies without centralized institutions to co-opt. I then examine where rulers reduced their transaction costs by investing in transport infrastructure. To this end, I gather road network data from British colonial reports (1900--1950) and use machine learning to digitize road maps of post-colonial Africa (1966--2016). Highlighting the extractive roots of local state reach, I find that resource-rich areas have featured more roads and better connections to ports and capitals throughout the century.  \
\
The second empirical part examines the effects of indirect rule and local state reach on development and conflict. As indirect colonial rule increased the bargaining power of local populations, indirectly ruled citizens received more public services in return for producing resources taxed by their governments, in particular cash crops. Analyses that exploit variation in indirect rule across neighboring ethnic groups and within groups split by French-British borders bolster this result. Citizens also profit from expanding trade with the government that comes with lower transaction costs. Assessing the impact of local changes in travel times towards administrative capitals, I find generally positive effects on local education, infant mortality, and nightlight emissions. Lastly, transport infrastructure allows governments to keep the peace but can also facilitate rebel mobilization. Drawing on credibly exogenous variation in simulated road networks, I find that roads that connect ethnic groups with national capitals curb conflicts, while roads that connect groups internally increase the risk of violence. \
\
My dissertation adds to the literature by analyzing the extractive roots of local state capacity in Africa, highlighting the interaction between colonial and precolonial institutions, and focusing on the trade between states and their citizens to explain local development and conflict. New data on local state capacity in 20th century Africa enable these contributions. </div>

<div id="box-177" class="is-hidden"> Sparse and uneven transport networks fundamentally limit states&#39; ability to project power and promote development in many African countries. However, not much is known about their historical roots. This project analyzes the colonial causes and consequences of transportation networks in colonial Africa between 1900 and 1966. I argue that colonial transport networks where mostly built to connect potential centers of production with ports rather than to facilitate exchange between colonies&#39; inhabitants or defend territory against challengers. Lowering transport costs to ports, (rail)roads unleashed local cash crop and mining revolutions, increasing exports and filling the states’ coffers with taxes on the same. Empirically, I collect data from British administrative reports to reconstruct the evolution of transportation networks in 8 colonies until 1940 and draw on a continental cross-section of roads observed in 1966. Using tools from network analysis, I assess local mineral and agricultural resources as one driver of networks’ geographical development. The results shed light on the extractive origins of colonial state building. </div>

<div id="box-216" class="is-hidden"> Research on ethnic politics and political violence has benefited substantially from the growing availability of cross-national, geo-coded data on ethnic settlement patterns. However, because existing datasets represent ethnic homelands using aggregate polygon features, they lack information on ethnic compositions at the local level. Addressing this gap, this article introduces the Spatially Interpolated Data on Ethnicity (SIDE) dataset, a collection of 253 near-continuous maps of local ethno-linguistic, religious, and ethno-religious settlement patterns in 47 low- and middle-income countries. We create these data using spatial interpolation and machine learning methods to generalize the ethnicity-related information in the geo-coded Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). For each DHS survey we provide the ethnic, religious, and ethno-religious compositions of cells on a raster that covers the respective countries at a resolution of 30 arc-seconds. The resulting data are optimized for use with geographic information systems (GIS) software. Comparisons of SIDE with existing categorical datasets and district-level census data from Uganda and Senegal are used to assess the data&#39;s accuracy. Finally, we use the new data to study the effects of local polarization between politically relevant ethnic groups, finding a positive effect on the risk of local violence such as riots and protests. However, local ethno-political polarization is not statistically associated with violent events pertaining to larger-scale processes such as civil wars. </div>
