### Abstract

Ethnic identities structure social space. Social scientists have therefore assembled many 
high-quality datasets on ethnic groups, in particular covering African countries. 
However, the integration of these datasets has not yet been brought to its full potential. 
We propose a consistent and comprehensive matching of 10'000 ethnic categories in the 
eleven most prominent datasets. We first match all ethnic categories to the linguistic 
database Ethnologue. We leverage this set of all known languages as an intermediate 
dictionary to provide a link between any two groups in the original data. Leveraging the 
structure of the linguistic trees, we can match ethnic groups on multiple levels of 
aggregation and take into account linguistic distances between them. This will help 
researchers to make the most out of the available data on ethnic groups in Africa. 

### Interlinked datasets

In total, we link ethnic lists drawn from eleven data sources:

* [Afrobarometer Surveys](http://www.afrobarometer.org/)
* [All Minorities at Risk (AMAR)](https://cidcm.umd.edu/research/all-minorities-risk-project)
* [Census data from IPUMS](https://international.ipums.org/international/index.shtml)
* [Ethnic Power Relations Dataset](https://growup.ethz.ch/)
* [Ethnologue languages](https://www.ethnologue.com/)
* Ethnic groups in [Francois, Trebbi & Rainer (2015)](https://doi.org/10.3982/ECTA11237)
* Ethnic groups from [Fearon (2003)](https://web.stanford.edu/group/ethnic/publicdata/publicdata.html)
* [GREG Data](https://icr.ethz.ch/data/greg/) (based on the Russian Atlas Miradova)
* [Demographic and Health Surveys](https://dhsprogram.com/data/)
* [Murdock Atlas](https://worldmap.harvard.edu/data/geonode:Murdock_EA_2011_vkZ)
* [Spatially Interpolated Data on Ethnicity (SIDE)](http://side.ethz.ch)
