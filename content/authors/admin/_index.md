I am, as of July 2019, a PostDoc at the [International Conflict Research Group](https://icr.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich and a visiting researcher at Harvard University's [IQSS](https://www.iq.harvard.edu/). 
My research and dissertation focuses on state building in twentieth century Africa and its effects on local development and conflict. 
At ETH Zurich, I am part of the ERC [NASTAC](https://icr.ethz.ch/research/nastac/) project through which analyzes the interplay between state (trans)formation and nationalism in Europe. 
Furthermore, I work on the effects of local ethnic demography on pre-election violence and ethnic favoritism in Africa.
 
To carry out my research, I have collected various sets of new, mostly geospatial data and have developed new measures of state reach, colonial indirect rule, and ethnic geographies.
